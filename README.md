# Ground Station
![alt text](demo.png)
This repository hosts the software of our Ground Station. Specifically, we use a Python script to save telemetry data from a serial port to a JSON file and we create real-time graphs of : Barometric Pressure, Temperature, Altitude, UV Radiation and Soil Moisture with respect to time, using React.js and Plotly.js, with the data received from our satellite. We also create a real-time 3D plot of the path that the satellite has followed since separation from the rocket.
